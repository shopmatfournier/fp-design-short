/*
* In Functional Design, there are two ways to encode functional domain
* constructors and operators:
*
* 1. Using a function or interface, whose methods execute the solution. This is
*    called the "executable" encoding in this course. It's a direct, executable
*    encoding of a domain. If some functional domain is modeled with a class
*    or case class, or an open trait that is implemented by classes, then it's
*    probably an executable encoding. [FINAL ENCODING]
*
* 2. Using a pure data structure, which declaratively describes the solution, but
*    which does not perform the solution. It's an abstract, "declarative"
*    encoding of a domain. If some functional domain type is modeled with a
*    sealed trait, then it's probably an abstract encoding, where the subtypes
*    of the sealed trait model individual operations and constructors in the
*    domain. [INITIAL ENCODING]
*
* In the second encoding, a so-called "executor" or "interpreter" or "compiler"
* translates the data structure, which merely models a solution, into either
* executable code or into another lower-level domain, which provides the
* capabilities modeled by the functional domain.
*
* Executable encodings are "open": anyone can add new constructors and
* operators, without updating existing code. On the other hand, executable
* encodings are not "introspectable": because they are not data, but rather,
* opaque executable machinery, they cannot be serialized, optimized, or
* converted to other encodings.
*
* Abstract encodings are "introspectable": because they are pure data, they
* can be serialized, optimized, and converted to other encodings, assuming
* their component parts have the same properties (not all abstract encodings
* do; if you embed a function inside an abstract encoding, it's becomes
* opaque). On the other hand, abstract encodings are "closed": no one can add
* new constructors or operators, without updating existing code.
*
* Summarizing the difference between executable and abstract encodings:
*
*  - Executable encodings have open constructors/operators, but closed
*    interpreters.
*  - Declarative encodings have closed constructors/operators, but open
*    interpreters.
*
* Note: Tagless-final an executable encoding, but where by making the "solutions"
* polymorphic, the choice of executor can be deferred arbitrarily.
*
* Legacy code prefers executable encodings; while many benefits of Functional
* Design can be seen best using abstract encodings.
